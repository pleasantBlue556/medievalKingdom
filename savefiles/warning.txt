please be very careful not to edit the names of the savefiles!
the save and load functions are hard-coded to only recognize save files named 'savefile(number).json'
if you get errors trying to load the files menu, this is likely why.

also...the save files are encoded...so...you can't really edit them (unless you're a genius)
